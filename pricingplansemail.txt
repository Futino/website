Dear Mr. Baptister,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for considering partnering with Futino. As promised, I am writing to provide you with more information about our pricing plans.
We have designed our pricing plans to be flexible and affordable, while still maintaining the quality of paying for premium services. Our website provides a detailed breakdown of the pricing options available, so you can choose the plan that best fits your needs. You can find our pricing plans by visiting our website at Futino Pricing.
Our partnership plan comes highly recommended for comprehensive and effective results. It is designed to help businesses like yours grow. This plan offers a cheaper price for creating the website and, in exchange, we are paid a percentage of the gross revenue brought to you by our website. We believe this plan is particularly beneficial for Bapta Safaris, being a new business, because it will help with the starting cost of the website. 
To ensure optimal online performance, a hosting and marketing plan is essential. By choosing the Partnership Plan, the cost for the hosting plan and marketing plan is also reduced greatly, meaning you have more flexibility to choose which plans you’d like regarding those.
At Futino, we take pride in providing high-quality services at competitive prices. We are confident that we can deliver the results you're looking for, and we look forward to working with you. Please let us know if you have any questions or if there's anything else we can help you with.
In addition to the pricing plans, we’ve also attached below the estimation sheet to find out how many hours and working days it will take to create the website. This will help you calculate the numbers for the plans you choose. If you’d like help with calculating any numbers in specific, please do let us know.
